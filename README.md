# scrollwm

Have you ever looked at Linux scrolling window managers and thought, "I wish I had that on windows..."  

No? I did for some reason, I guess.  

It's (inspired by) [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) but for Microsoft Windows! This is just a proof-of-concept I threw together in a day, so nothing seriously meant for daily use. That said, I plan to keep using it myself.
